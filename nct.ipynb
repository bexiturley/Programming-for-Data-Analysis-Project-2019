    "When we were given the problem statement I decided to look into the National Car Testing statics.  My own one had recently had to under go one and while it failed the first time it passed the retest.  I started to wonder that if there was any correlation between the car year of manufacture, model and pass rate.  As the 2019 year data is incomplete I chose 2018 instead.  My car had also done the nct in 2018 and once again it had failed the original test but passed the retest.\n",

    "Compulsory car testing was introduced in Ireland in 2000 as part of an EU Directive that makes car testing compulsory in all member states. It is an offence to drive a car without displaying a National Car Testing Service disc, if the car is liable for testing. Offenders will face Class C fines, as well as penalty points.\n",

    "The test is called the National Car Test and is carried out on behalf of the Government by the National Car Testing Service Ltd (NCTS). The test is aimed at improving road safety and enhancing environmental protection. \n",

    "If a vehicle is over 4 years old it has to take a test.  From the vehicle being 4 years to under 10 years old it has to be tested every 2 years.  Once the vehicle gets to 10 years but less than 30, it then has to be tested every year.  Between 30 and 39 years old the vehicle must be tested every 2 years again and it can not be used for commercial purposes.  That would apply mostly to vintage cars that would be mostly for show only.  There are exemptions to the nct also.  Vehicles registered prior to 1st January 1980 so not need to be tested, cars permanently based on islands that are not connected to the mainland do not require testing and motor vehicles belonging to the Armed Forces, the Garda Síochána or the Fire Service are not subject to mandatory testing.\n",

The Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness Test (CVRT) is a roadworthiness test for all commercial vehicles, buses with more than eight passenger seats and ambulances, all over one year old.  There are two types of commercial vehicle tests, one for Light Commercial Vehicles (LCVs) and one for Heavy Commercial Vehicles (HCVs).\n",

    "Initially, I began by looking at the the nct.ie to see what information was available.  There was a section on statistics which had the pass, fail refusal and fail dangerous rated for 2018.  https://www.ncts.ie/1127\n",
    "This was interesting but I wanted to see if a particular make/model out performed the rest of them or were they all broadly similar.  I then looked into the central statistics office statbank which not only provided the figures of pass/fail rates, it also broke them down by each centre. https://statbank.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?maintable=ROA10&PLanguage=0  \n",
